# Book-Recommendation-KNN
# ðŸ“š Book Recommendation Engine using KNN

This project is a simple **Book Recommendation System** built using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm.  
It suggests books to users based on similarity in their preferences.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Uses **KNN** for recommendations  
- Works on user-based similarity (cosine/euclidean distance)  
- Processes dataset using **Pandas & NumPy**  
- Built with **Scikit-learn**

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn
